9.28: FCN segmenatation with acc around 0.8
Why .csv: to make sure previous split is kept when we test; split can be exported
##### TODO
1. (core) make main.py invisible (data directly interact with model)
1. why batch size has such a big influence on performance on smooth_histogram
1. make config a python file?
1. make all the writing local to this project
1. testing and inferencing
1. Think of a way to skip preprocess (???)
1. Import pc segmentation
1. Try changing segmentation head for FCN
1. Add result analysis for different tasks (image segmentation first)
1. Aim for better speed
