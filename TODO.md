9.28: FCN segmenatation with acc around 0.8
##### TODO
1. dynamic data directory (if a data directory is provided, just use that data directory, otherwise find the dataset in a directory configured as data_root)
1. fit a new dataset
1. metric list
1. testing and inferencing
1. Think of a way to skip preprocess (???)
1. Import pc segmentation
1. Try changing segmentation head for FCN
1. Add result analysis for different tasks (image segmentation first)
1. Aim for better speed
